         <p style="color:black; font-family:times new roman; font-size:135%;"> I was born in Nicosia in 2000 and grew up as an only child till 2008, that was when my sister was born. I have always wanted a big brother or/and sister but unfortunanetly I became the big brother that I have wanted. Which is actually ok-ish for now and I am pretty sure that it is going to be a wonderful thing to be a big brother later on but I still sometimes do wish that I had an older sibling. <br> <br>
         We as a family lived in an apartment in Nicosia untill my sister was born. After she was born we stayed in that apartment for another year and moved out to a house. I don't know the specific reason as to why we had to move out but it is safe to assume that the rent was a bit high for the apartments worth, well I guess it was really close to the center too so that may be the other reason but other than that nothing else really. <br> <br>
        I was going to school at Near East College (NEC) from kindergarten up to high school (Grade 9 in English/9. Sınıf in Turkish) and after I passed the grade 9 i switched schools and went to Türk Eğitim Derneği (TED) till graduation. My time in NEC was pretty fun, made some friends, did a lot of crazy stuff and made a lot of good memories with my friends. Whenever I heard that I was switching schools I felt sad and didn't want to go to the other school since all my friends are still in NEC. However, as you know I wasn't the one paying the money for the school and my parents had really good points as why i should change schools. So I accepted it and moved on, it was though at first. Anyways, new school new me I had to try and do my best as the lectures were starting to get harder and harder since i was close to graduating from high school so I tried to not make friends at first and wanted to focus on my lectures. Thankfully that did not happen because if it did, I would be lonely and pretty much become depressed throught the entire high school. The best friends I had and still have are from this TED school. I couldn't have asked for more because they are like my brothers and sisters right now which is amazing! I didn't know that these types of people existed. They are understanding, charming, kind hearted and much more!!! I am really lucky to have these guys as my friends. They gave me a purpose in life, a purpose to spend time together without worrying about anything and having the best time of our lives by going out together to theme parks, cinemas, restaurants, coffee shops and much more places to be. <br> <br>
        I don't have to say anything about my parents since they are the only reason why I am able to experience this life. I love them from the bottom of my heart and wish them a healthy everlasting life! I am not able to type any more since I just started the journey of my life about 3 years ago when I first got in to the university so umm yeah I believe that amazing and beautiful stuff awaits me as the years go on and on.  </p>
