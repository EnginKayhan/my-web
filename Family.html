         <p style="color:black; font-family:times new roman; font-size:125%;"> We are a small family that consists of my mom, dad, sister and I. Also we have a dog and a bird, they also count as a family member too! Our dog's name is Çapkın when translated to English it has a lot of meaning but the most suitable one would be the word "Flirtatious" because all he does is run around and mess with us non-stop. The bird's name is Boncuk, which means bead in English and also it's a she. When the Sun is out all she does is sing untill the Sun goes down. It can be annoying sometimes but from her singing you know that she is having a good time! </p> <br>
