         <p style="color:black; font-family:times new roman; font-size:125%;"> My favourite hobbies are playing video games, playing volleyball, swimming and listening to music. First of all, I feel a great sense of enjoyment from playing video games because games give me lots of fun and happiness, specially when I play with friends. Gaming helps me release some stress and also helps me keep a good mood. <br> <br>
         Listening to music makes me lose connection with the World and go to my imagination World where i am stress free and happy as one can get! I strongly advise everyone to listen to music whenever they feel down or happy or doesn't matter what mood you are in if you can. <br> <br>
        The other two hobbies left are the ones that i kind of don't do much mainly because it got boring over time. However, playing volleyball and swimming are both fun and good sports that you should do if you are able to. They are both fun and physically good for you, also you can do them with your friends as well! It creates a quality time to be spent.</p>
